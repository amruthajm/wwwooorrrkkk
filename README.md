In this repository I have files which are solutions to some of the amfoss tasks.
They include mainly python programs regarding:
-web scrapping,
-captcha breaking,
-sending a mail via python code automatically rather than using the app,
-python code for sorting and to check a palindrome,and
-login page which requires users email/username along with the password.
